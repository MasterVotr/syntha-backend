Main priorities for now:
* make port position update when moving module to make connection move aswell
* logic for ports and modules
* make module implementation more generic so that each module can "fill in the blanks" with its content
* keep track of connections and order of elements with a tree like structure
* IN and OUT modules
* save connections in the correct way. Find a way to give them each its own color and the correct portIds
* make some modules that are already complete and more similar to fl studio patcher and others which instead look more like VCV rack modules to implement that "both in a high and low level" way
* prests page (like gmod workshop content, you can click + to add it to your account)
* user saved presets page (double click to open in playground)
* saving preset: with own name
